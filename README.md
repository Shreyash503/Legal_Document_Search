📘 Legal Document Search Assistant (AI-Powered RAG System)

An intelligent AI-based legal document question-answering system that allows users to:

Upload any legal or policy PDF

Automatically process the PDF using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Ask natural language questions

Receive precise, 2-line answers generated by Groq’s Llama 3.1 model

This project uses Flask, LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace embeddings, and a modern animated frontend.

🚀 Features
🧾 PDF Upload

Upload any type of legal or academic document such as:

Court judgments

Acts & Rules

Government policies

Budget speeches

Research papers

⚡ AI-Powered Answers

Ask any question; the system performs semantic search and responds intelligently.

🧠 RAG Pipeline

PDF → text extraction

Text → chunks (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)

Chunks → embeddings (HuggingFace)

Stored in Chroma Vector DB

Relevant chunks → LLM (Groq Llama-3.1)

2-line answer generated

🎨 Modern Frontend

3D glassmorphism UI

Professional legal-themed background

Smooth animations

Fully responsive design

🔧 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Inside the backend folder:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

📄 requirements.txt
flask
flask-cors
python-dotenv
PyPDF2
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-text-splitters
sentence-transformers
chromadb
langchain-groq
langchain-huggingface

2️⃣ Add Groq API Key

Create a .env file:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here


Get your key:
🔗 https://console.groq.com/keys

3️⃣ Start the Flask Server
python app.py


Server URL:

http://localhost:8000


This serves both backend + frontend.

🧠 How the System Works

User uploads PDF

Backend extracts text using PyPDF2

Text is split into meaningful chunks

Embeddings are generated using HuggingFace

Stored temporarily in ChromaDB

User asks a question

Best-matching PDF chunks are retrieved

Groq Llama-3.1 model generates a succinct 2-line answer

💬 Example Usage

After uploading a “Budget Speech PDF”, ask:

What is the Centre of Excellence in AI for Education?


Or for a legal act:

Define the punishment for cyber fraud in this act.
